The DeepSeek implementation only manages to get through the reference guide questions and seems to maintain no memory
of the responses after one follow-up question. It frequently takes longer than 3 minutes to process and once processed,
the question asked is nonsensical or defaults to "Can you elaborate on that?". DeepSeek fails the RAG test.

The OpenAI implementation successfully asks insightful follow ups and although at times it is redundant, this is an
issue of prompting. With more creatively crafted prompts, the model would still successfully carry out a conversation
that effectively gathers user perspectives on the topic. The implementation rarely defaults to "Can you elaborate on that?"
and succeeds in using RAG to conduct the interview.
The following is the OpenAI GPT-4o implementation output:
