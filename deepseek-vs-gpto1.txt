    Broken Rules:
        Rhyming Zig-Zag (Rule #1)  
        Answer Me! (Rule #9) – line #6 does not end with a question mark  
        No ‘E’ Allowed (Rule #10) – no stanza omits the letter ‘e’ entirely  
        Sound Effects (Rule #11) – stanza 4 does not clearly contain a classic onomatopoeic exclamation (e.g., “bang,” “pop,” etc.)
